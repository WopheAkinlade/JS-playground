# JS Playground(Tricks and Methods)

I created this repository as a store for new methods and ideas I discover as I write more and more Javascript code

## Layout of Repo

Inside the [scripts folder](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/tree/main/scripts) are named Javascript files that contain the aforementioned tips and tricks that I've discovered as I advance as a software developer. Change the linked scripts in [index.html](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/blob/main/index.html) for the files to have an effect on the webpage body.

### [Close Menu](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/blob/main/scripts/close-menu-on-click.js) 
The aim of this file is to enable a toggling functionality on a dropdown menu on a webpage.

### [Promises](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/blob/main/scripts/promises.js)
This file was made to learn how to use Promises in Javascripts

### [Promises with Javascript](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/blob/main/scripts/promises%20with%20typescript.ts)
This is a typescript version of [promises.js](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/blob/main/scripts/promises.js). <br>
[Promises with typescript.js](https://github.com/WopheAkinlade/JS-playground/blob/main/scripts/promises%20with%20typescript.js) is just the Javascript configuration of this file.
